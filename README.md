WeatherApp

Overview
The WeatherApp is a simple, responsive web application built using React.js and Material UI that allows users to search for and view the weather information of any city. The app displays key weather details, including temperature, humidity, and more, based on data fetched from an external weather API.

The application consists of three main components:

InfoBox - Displays the weather information.
SearchBox - A search form to input the city name.
WeatherApp - The main component that ties everything together.
Features
Weather Search: Users can search for weather data by entering a city name.
Dynamic Weather Display: Depending on the temperature and humidity, the application displays different weather conditions with corresponding icons and background images.
Error Handling: Displays an error message if an invalid city is searched.
Material UI Integration: Utilizes Material UI components for styling and icons for a sleek design.
Components

The weather conditions (like hot, cold, or rainy) are represented visually by images and corresponding icons:

Temperature > 26Â°C: Displays a sunny weather icon and a warm image.

Humidity > 80%: Displays a storm icon and a rainy image.
